            Hi! Im Stephen Jochen, I am originally from Lancaster, PA. I have lived all over the U.S. but spent most of
            my life in Montana. I moved to Richomd about 4 years ago to start a new job. I recently left that job to
            start a coding class at the University of Richomd and have started brodening my coding horizons.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy playing hockey, watching sports and doing various activities outside. I have been playing hockey since I was a sophmore in highschool, I have always played golaie. Growing up I played soccer when I was in elementary school and once I was old enough I played football.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that I have moved to Richmond, I want to start focusing on my career. Finding a career that you like is no easy task, lucky for me I may have stumbled upon a career I realy enjoy. I started coding late in 2018 and decided I wanted to see how I might be able to turn this into a career. I found the U of R coding bootcamp and decided that this was the best place to kickstart my career!
